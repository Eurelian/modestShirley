Difficulties:
Adjusting Bootstrap, there is good and bad to Bs:
. good for quick and simple site building
. bad to customize beyond built-in features, components or elements.
Necessary to nest a lot of div's with Bs classes to get the footer working
. constrained containers and rows nested in a full viewport width container (.container-fluid).
. Hovered elements are not easy to manipulate in Bs.
Applying javascript for filtering recipes to filter button (abandoned idea).
Co-ordinating CSS files.

Possible evolutions:
. Adding javascript to filter recipes.
. Attatch a CMS for content.
. Adding social media API's to interact with the page
. . OpenGraph features (Facebook).
. . Google Analytics (analysis of user interaction data).
. Better division of Categories.
. Implementing a proper search function (maybe elastic search).

Thanks to 
Bootstrap for responsive framework.
